## 💡 Implementation Tips

### For Backend Developers

1. **Start with P0.6-US-001 (Price Transparency)**
   - No dependencies, can start immediately
   - Foundation for all other pricing-related stories
   - Test with multiple VAT rates (DE, AT, CH)

2. **Parallel Track: P0.6-US-002 (VAT-ID Validation)**
   - Integration with VIES API (free)
   - Test with mock API first
   - Handle API failures gracefully

3. **Focus on Compliance Integration**
   - Every feature needs audit logging
   - Encrypt sensitive data (PII, costs)
   - Ensure tenant isolation

### For Frontend Developers

1. **Start with Checkout Checkboxes (P0.6-US-006)**
   - Simple component, reusable pattern
   - Foundation for legal gate
   - Test accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

2. **Work on Footer Links (P0.6-US-007)**
   - Global component affecting all pages
   - Consistent across responsive design
   - Coordinate with legal team on content

3. **Focus on User Experience**
   - Clear error messages
   - Transparent cost breakdown
   - Mobile-first design
   - Keyboard accessibility
