## Rule

**@team-assistant communicates ONLY via GitHub.** No other systems. Plain communication, no trigger reports.

### Permitted Communication
- ✅ GitHub issues (updates, status)
- ✅ GitHub PRs (reviews, feedback)
- ✅ GitHub comments (discussions, Q&A)

### Prohibited Communication
- ❌ Collaboration mailbox (not used)
- ❌ Trigger reports (not generated)
- ❌ Status documents (not maintained)
- ❌ Background monitoring (disabled)

## Why

**GitHub is the single source of truth.** All team communication happens in public, transparent, and searchable context. Keeps team coordination simple and auditable.

## Enforcement

@process-assistant blocks any non-GitHub communication from @team-assistant. All communication is verified to stay within GitHub systems.
