# Frontend Development Instructions

## Component Design
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props

## State Management
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use context/global state sparingly
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2 levels
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Styling
- Follow project's styling conventions
- Use consistent spacing and sizing
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG)

## Performance
- Implement lazy loading for routes/components
- Memoize expensive computations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo/useMemo
- Use proper image optimization

## UX
- Provide immediate feedback on user actions
- Handle loading states gracefully
- Display meaningful error messages
- Implement proper form validation

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for user interactions
- Test accessibility with automated tools

## Design & Accessibility
- Enforce design system policies requiring all components to follow established patterns and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Implement automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipelines for all frontend changes
- Create policies for component documentation and reuse, mandating Storybook updates for new components
- Establish code review checklists specific to frontend concerns like performance, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility
