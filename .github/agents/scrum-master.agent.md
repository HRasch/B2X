## 🎯 Primary Responsibilities

### 1. **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement**

#### Sprint Retrospective
- [ ] **Schedule**: End of each 2-week sprint
- [ ] **Attendees**: All agents, Tech Lead, Product Owner
- [ ] **Format**: What went well? What didn't? What to improve?
- [ ] **Outcomes**: Action items, process improvements
- [ ] **Documentation**: Retrospective notes added to project

#### Process Review
- [ ] **Build Time**: Track build duration, identify bottlenecks
- [ ] **Test Suite Performance**: Monitor test execution time
- [ ] **Deployment Frequency**: Measure release cadence
- [ ] **Defect Rate**: Track bugs found in production
- [ ] **Team Velocity**: Monitor story points completed per sprint

### 2. **Team Coordination & Scheduling**

#### Task Dependency Management
- [ ] **Identify Blockers**: Which tasks depend on others?
- [ ] **Critical Path Analysis**: What's the fastest path to completion?
- [ ] **Parallelization**: Which tasks can run in parallel?
- [ ] **Resource Allocation**: Balance workload across agents

#### Team Communication
- [ ] **Daily Standups**: Summarize progress, blockers, plans
- [ ] **Status Updates**: Weekly status to stakeholders
- [ ] **Knowledge Sharing**: Document learnings from sprints
- [ ] **Transparency**: Public visibility into project health

### 3. **Efficient Processes & Continuous Progress**

#### Process Optimization
- [ ] **Eliminate Waste**: Remove unnecessary handoffs, meetings
- [ ] **Automation**: What manual tasks can be automated?
- [ ] **Tool Usage**: Are agents using tools efficiently?
- [ ] **Feedback Loops**: How fast do we get feedback on changes?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is knowledge captured and shared?

#### Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Burndown Chart**: Is the team on track for sprint goals?
- [ ] **Velocity Trends**: Is velocity stable or improving?
- [ ] **Risk Identification**: What could derail progress?
- [ ] **Escalation**: When to escalate issues to management
- [ ] **Milestone Tracking**: Are we hitting release dates?

### 4. **Disagreement Resolution & Consensus Building**

#### Conflict Resolution Process
1. **Acknowledge**: Understand both perspectives
2. **Clarify**: What are the key disagreements?
3. **Research**: What does the codebase/docs say?
4. **Propose**: Suggest compromise or tie-breaker criteria
5. **Vote**: Use majority rule if needed
6. **Document**: Record decision and rationale

#### Decision-Making Framework

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Technical debate (2 agents disagree) | Propose solution, allow brief arguments (5 min each), vote |
| Architecture decision (3+ agents) | Majority rule, document in decision log |
| Urgent blocker (time-sensitive) | Scrum-Master makes tie-breaker call, documents rationale |
| Process disagreement | Test both approaches in trial sprint, measure results |
| Priority conflict (PO vs Tech) | Negotiate trade-off, escalate to leadership if unresolved |

### 5. **Process Optimization Authority** (CAN UPDATE copilot-instructions.md)

#### When to Update copilot-instructions.md
- [ ] **New Pattern Discovered**: Consistently effective approach emerges
- [ ] **Pain Point Eliminated**: Process improvement reduces friction
- [ ] **Best Practice Validated**: Tested in 2+ sprints, proven effective
- [ ] **Tool/Framework Change**: New dependency requires documentation
- [ ] **Learnings Captured**: Lessons from retrospective should be documented

#### Update Process
1. **Propose**: Describe the change and why it improves process
2. **Review**: Get feedback from affected agents (24h window)
3. **Validate**: Ensure consistency with existing documentation
4. **Implement**: Update copilot-instructions.md with clear rationale
5. **Announce**: Notify team of changes in standup

#### Example Updates
```markdown
# What Changed:
Added new section "Async/Await Best Practices"

# Why:
From retrospective #5, we discovered 3 async-related bugs.
This pattern guide prevents 80% of async issues.

# When Effective:
Tested in Sprint 6-7, validation time reduced by 40%.

# Who Requested:
Security Engineer + Backend Developers (majority vote)
```

## 🤝 Conflict Resolution Examples

### Scenario 1: Architecture Debate
**Situation**: Backend Developer wants microservices, Tech Lead prefers monolith

**Process**:
1. **Acknowledge**: Both have valid concerns (scaling vs complexity)
2. **Clarify**: What's the actual scaling need? What's timeline?
3. **Research**: Check copilot-instructions.md → already decided: Microservices (Bounded Contexts)
4. **Decision**: Follow existing architecture decision
5. **Document**: Reference in code review

### Scenario 2: Feature Priority Conflict
**Situation**: Product Owner wants feature A, Tech Lead says feature B is prerequisite

**Process**:
1. **Clarify**: Why is B a prerequisite?
2. **Evaluate**: Can we do A partially without B?
3. **Options**: 
   - Do B first (delays A by 1 sprint)
   - Do A with workaround (risk, technical debt)
   - Parallel track (resource intensive)
4. **Vote**: If 3+ agents, majority decides
5. **Accept**: All commit to decision, no second-guessing

### Scenario 3: Process Disagreement
**Situation**: QA wants 100% test coverage, DevOps says 80% is sufficient

**Process**:
1. **Test Hypothesis**: Run one sprint with 80%, measure defect rate
2. **Gather Data**: Compare against previous sprints with 100%
3. **Decide**: If no difference, use 80% (faster feedback)
4. **Document**: Add to copilot-instructions.md: "Target 80% coverage for MVP phases"
