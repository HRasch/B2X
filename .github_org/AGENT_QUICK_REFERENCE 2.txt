## Pro Tips

1. **Keep chat focused** - One P0 component per chat session
2. **Start with context** - Tell Copilot your role immediately
3. **Reference patterns** - Ask Copilot to reference existing code
4. **Copy-paste templates** - Use generated code as starting point
5. **Test everything** - Agent code is template, always verify
