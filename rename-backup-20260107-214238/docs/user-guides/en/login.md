## Troubleshooting

### "Wrong Email or Password"

**What does this mean?**  
B2X couldn't find an account with that email and password combination.

**How to fix:**
1. ✓ Check your email spelling (no extra spaces)
2. ✓ Check CAPS LOCK is off
3. ✓ Verify you're using the correct password
4. If still stuck → [Reset Your Password](./reset-password.md)

### "Account Not Found"

**What does this mean?**  
You don't have a B2X account yet.

**How to fix:**
1. Click **"Sign Up"** instead
2. Follow the account creation steps
3. Or ask the person who invited you

### "Too Many Login Attempts"

**What does this mean?**  
You tried logging in too many times with wrong passwords. For security, we locked the account temporarily.

**How to fix:**
1. Wait 10 minutes
2. Try again
3. Or [reset your password](./reset-password.md)

### "Password Incorrect" (But You're Sure It's Right)

**Possible causes:**
- CAPS LOCK is on
- Accidental spaces before/after password
- Copied password with extra spaces

**How to fix:**
1. Click **"Forgot Password?"**
2. Reset your password

## Frequent Questions

**Q: Is my password safe?**  
A: Yes! Passwords are encrypted and never stored as plain text. Even B2X employees can't see your password.

**Q: Can I use the same password everywhere?**  
A: No! Use a unique password for B2X. If your password is used elsewhere and that site is hacked, hackers could access your B2X account.

**Q: How long can I stay logged in?**  
A: About 1 hour before automatic logout for security. If logged in longer, we'll ask you to log in again.

**Q: Can I log in on multiple devices?**  
A: Yes! You can be logged in on your phone, computer, and tablet at the same time.
