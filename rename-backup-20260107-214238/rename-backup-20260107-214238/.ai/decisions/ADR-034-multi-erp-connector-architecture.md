## Problem

Following ADR-033's approval of downloadable ERP-connector coupled to CLI, and building on existing integrations (enventa Trade ERP via KB-021, Craft Software punchout via ADR-029), we need to design an extensible architecture to support multiple ERP systems beyond enventa. Current limitations include:

### Current State Analysis

**Existing ERP Integrations:**
- **enventa Trade ERP** (KB-021): .NET Framework 4.8 console application, single-threaded, proprietary ORM, large catalogs (1.5M+ articles), connection pooling required
- **Craft Software Punchout** (ADR-029): Multi-format adapters for IDS Connect, Open Masterdata, OSD, OCI standards supporting Taifun, MSoft, GWS systems
- **Downloadable CLI Coupling** (ADR-033): Tenant-admin downloadable ERP-connector with administration CLI integration

**Current Architecture Limitations:**
- Monolithic ERP-connector design tightly coupled to enventa
- No pluggable architecture for additional ERP systems
- Manual configuration and deployment per ERP type
- Limited tenant self-service for ERP selection and management
- Versioning and compatibility challenges across ERP types

### Market Requirements

**Target ERP Systems:**

### Core Framework Components

**Standardized Interfaces:**
```csharp
public interface IErpConnector
{
    Task InitializeAsync(ErpConfiguration config);
    Task<ErpCapabilities> GetCapabilitiesAsync();
    Task SyncCatalogAsync(SyncContext context);
    Task<ErpOrderResult> CreateOrderAsync(ErpOrder order);
    Task<ErpCustomerData> GetCustomerDataAsync(string customerId);
}

public interface IErpAdapterFactory
{
    string ErpType { get; }
    IErpConnector CreateConnector(TenantContext context);
    ErpConfigurationSchema GetConfigurationSchema();
}
```

**Shared Services:**
- **Authentication Service**: Unified OAuth2/JWT token management
- **Multi-Tenant Context**: Tenant isolation and configuration injection
- **Audit Logger**: Structured logging for compliance and debugging
- **Health Monitor**: Real-time status and performance metrics
- **Version Manager**: Semantic versioning and compatibility checking

### ERP-Specific Connectors

**Connector Registry:**
```json
{
  "connectors": {
    "enventa": {
      "version": "2.1.0",
      "framework": "net48",
      "capabilities": ["catalog-sync", "order-processing", "customer-data"],
      "downloadUrl": "/api/erp/download/enventa/v2.1.0"
    },
    "sap": {
      "version": "1.0.0", 
      "framework": "net8.0",
      "capabilities": ["catalog-sync", "order-processing", "real-time-queries"],
      "downloadUrl": "/api/erp/download/sap/v1.0.0"
    },
    "craft-punchout": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "framework": "net8.0", 
      "capabilities": ["punchout-catalog", "multi-format-support"],
      "downloadUrl": "/api/erp/download/craft-punchout/v1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**Download and Management Strategy:**

**Secure Distribution:**
- Signed binaries with certificate validation
- Version-controlled downloads via authenticated API
- Tamper detection and integrity verification
- CDN distribution for global performance

**Tenant Self-Service Workflow:**
```bash
# Discover supported ERPs
B2X erp list-supported
