# 📢 Iteration 001 Kickoff Notification

**TO:** Team (@Backend, @Frontend, @Architect, @ProductOwner, @TechLead, @ScrumMaster, @QA, @Security, @Legal, @DevOps)  
**FROM:** @ScrumMaster  
**DATE:** December 30, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** 🚀 Iteration 001 Development Started - No Fixed Dates, Velocity-Based Execution

---

## ✅ Iteration 001 is LIVE

We're moving from calendar-based sprints to **velocity-based iterations**. This is a fundamental shift in how we work.

### What Changed?

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|---|---|
| 2-week sprints (fixed dates) | Iterations (velocity-based) |
| "Ready by Jan 13" | "Complete when 28 SP done" |
| Weekly breakdown | Phase-based (flexible sequence) |
| Date-based pressure | Velocity-based metrics |

**Condition:** Daily code review with @TechLead  
**Status:** Ready to start now  
**Daily:** Log completed SP, daily architecture oversight

### @Architect
**Architecture Review:** (2 SP)  
**Status:** Ready to start now  
**Daily:** Document decisions, validate patterns

### @ProductOwner
**Planning Documents:** (2 SP)  
**Status:** Ready to start now  
**Daily:** Feature specs, acceptance criteria

### @TechLead
**Daily Code Reviews:** (Issue #56 oversight)  
**Status:** Ready to review  
**Daily:** Architecture reviews, code quality gates

### Others
**Support Roles:** Available for blockers, questions, escalations  
**Contribution:** Log any work in ITERATION_001_TRACKING.md

## 📊 How Velocity Works

**We measure progress in story points, not days:**

```
Target: 28 SP (iteration completes when reached)
Committed: 34 SP (buffer work)

Daily Log:
  Day 1: 5 SP completed → Running total: 5 SP
  Day 2: 4 SP completed → Running total: 9 SP
  Day 3: 6 SP completed → Running total: 15 SP
  ...
  Goal: Reach 28 SP
```

**No specific end date.** When 28 SP is done, iteration closes. Might be 3 days, might be 2 weeks—doesn't matter.

---

## 📋 Daily Workflow

**Each day:**

1. Open: `.ai/sprint/ITERATION_001_TRACKING.md`
2. Log completed SP in "Daily Velocity Log"
3. Update "Work Item Status" table
4. Note any blockers in "Blockers & Risks"
5. Next day, repeat

**Example entry:**
```
Day 1: 5 SP (Issue #57: 2 SP audit, Issue #56: 3 SP analysis)
Blockers: None
Next: Issue #57 - Start package updates
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Iteration 001 succeeds when:**
- ✅ 28 SP velocity achieved (minimum)
- ✅ All Phase 1 items complete
- ✅ Code quality gates passed
- ✅ Architecture decisions documented
- ✅ Team ready for Phase 2

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Do This
- ✅ Update velocity tracking daily
- ✅ Flag blockers immediately
- ✅ Code reviews with team leads
- ✅ Follow architecture patterns
- ✅ Tests must pass

### Don't Do This
- ❌ Don't wait for specific dates
- ❌ Don't skip velocity logging
- ❌ Don't ignore blockers
- ❌ Don't skip tests for speed
- ❌ Don't compromise quality

### Deferred to Iteration 2
- ⏳ Issue #15 (Compliance) - Awaiting legal sign-off
- ⏳ Issues #20-#28 (P0.6 suite) - Blocked by #15
- ⏳ Issue #48 (Testing) - Strategic deferral

**These don't block Phase 1 work.**
