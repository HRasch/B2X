# ADR-041: Figma-based Tenant Design Integration

**DocID**: `ADR-041`  
**Status**: Accepted | **Owner**: @Architect  
**Created**: 2026-01-06  
**Deciders**: @SARAH, @Architect, @Frontend  
**Consulted**: @Backend, @Security, @DevOps  

## Context

The B2Connect platform requires tenant-customizable UI designs to support white-labeling and brand customization. Current theming system (ADR-040) provides basic CSS/SCSS customization, but lacks visual design tools for non-technical users. Tenants need an intuitive way to customize their storefront designs without deep technical knowledge.

The feasibility analysis revealed that Figma's API provides robust capabilities for design token extraction, component library synchronization, and automated asset generation. This would enable tenants to design in Figma and automatically sync changes to their B2Connect instances.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Custom In-App Design Editor
- **Description**: Build a custom design editor within the admin interface using Canvas API or similar
- **Pros**: Full control, integrated workflow, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: High development cost (6-9 months), maintenance burden, limited design capabilities compared to professional tools
- **Feasibility**: Medium - Requires significant frontend expertise and ongoing maintenance

### Option 2: Figma API Integration (Chosen)
- **Description**: Integrate with Figma's REST API and webhooks to sync designs from Figma files to tenant themes
- **Pros**: Leverages professional design tools, familiar to designers, automated sync, rich design system support
- **Cons**: External dependency on Figma, API rate limits, requires Figma team/workspace setup
- **Feasibility**: High - Well-documented API, proven patterns in industry, aligns with existing theming architecture

### Option 3: Adobe Creative Cloud Integration
- **Description**: Use Adobe's APIs for XD or Photoshop integration
- **Pros**: Professional tools, comprehensive design capabilities
- **Cons**: More complex licensing, higher costs, less developer-friendly API
- **Feasibility**: Low - Complex authentication, less mature APIs, higher integration effort

### Option 4: Open Source Alternatives (Penpot, Excalidraw)
- **Description**: Self-host open source design tools and integrate via APIs
- **Pros**: No external licensing costs, full control, community support
- **Cons**: Less mature tools, limited professional features, additional infrastructure overhead
- **Feasibility**: Medium - Would require evaluation and potential customization of tools

## Decision

Implement Figma API integration for tenant design customization with the following architecture:

### Integration Components

1. **Figma API Client**: .NET service for API communication and token management
2. **Design Token Extractor**: Parses Figma files to extract colors, typography, spacing, and component variants
3. **Asset Pipeline**: Automated generation of optimized CSS, images, and theme files
4. **Webhook Handler**: Real-time sync when Figma designs are updated
5. **Tenant Design Repository**: Database storage for design configurations and version history

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic design token sync (colors, fonts, spacing)
2. **Phase 2**: Component variant extraction and CSS generation
3. **Phase 3**: Image asset optimization and CDN integration
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (animations, responsive breakpoints)

### Security & Permissions

- Figma access tokens stored encrypted in tenant configuration
- Read-only access to specified Figma team libraries
- Audit logging for all design sync operations
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse

### Brainstormed Enhancements (Post-Decision)

- **AI-Supported Integration**: AI analyzes Figma exports for code generation, conflict resolution, and optimizations.
- **Component Gallery**: Shared Figma library with pre-built components for tenant reuse.
- **Server-Side Models**: C# models for components with metadata, configs, and i18n support.
- **AI-Generated Templates**: Dynamic template creation based on B2Connect's UI state.
- **MCP Integration**: Use MCP for layout-design via CLI commands and AI assistants.
- **Versioning Strategy**: Database-backed versions with rollback, audit trails, and auto-drafts for AI changes.
- **Testmode**: Preview links for staging environments with A/B testing and automated validation.
- **Tiered Approach**: Basic (zero-cost manual) and Premium (full AI/sync) tiers for broad adoption.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Designer Empowerment**: Non-technical users can customize designs using familiar tools
- **Brand Consistency**: Direct sync from design system ensures pixel-perfect implementation
- **Time-to-Market**: Faster customization cycles for new tenants
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple tenants with isolated design repositories
- **Integration**: Leverages existing theming infrastructure (ADR-040)

### Negative
- **External Dependency**: Reliance on Figma's API availability and pricing changes
- **Learning Curve**: Tenants need Figma training for effective use
- **API Limits**: Figma's rate limits may require queuing for large design files
- **Cost**: Figma team licenses required for professional use

### Risks
- **API Changes**: Figma API evolution could require maintenance
- **Data Privacy**: Design files may contain sensitive brand assets
- **Performance**: Large design files could impact sync performance

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement caching and incremental sync to reduce API calls
- Provide fallback to manual theme editing if Figma is unavailable
- Regular monitoring of API usage and limits
- Comprehensive error handling and user notifications

## Implementation Notes

- Extend existing `ScssCompilationService` for Figma-generated stylesheets
- Add new domain service `FigmaDesignSyncService` in Theming bounded context
- Database schema additions for design token storage
- Frontend admin interface for Figma project configuration
- Documentation for tenant designers on Figma setup and best practices
