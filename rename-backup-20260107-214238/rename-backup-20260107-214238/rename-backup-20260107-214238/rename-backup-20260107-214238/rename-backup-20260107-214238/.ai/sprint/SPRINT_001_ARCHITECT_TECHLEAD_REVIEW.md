### **Issue #56: Store UI/UX Modernization (13 SP)** ⚠️ MONITOR
**Owner:** @Frontend  
**Architect Assessment:**
```
Architecture Impact:        MEDIUM (UI layer only)
Service Boundary Impact:    NONE
API Contract Changes:       NONE (existing APIs sufficient)
State Management:           REVIEW NEEDED
Risk Level:                 🟡 MEDIUM (scope creep risk)
```

**Key Concerns:**
- [ ] Tailwind CSS migration from current styling
- [ ] Component architecture refactoring (breaking changes?)
- [ ] State management (Pinia store consistency)
- [ ] Responsive design requirements
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA target)

**TechLead Assessment:**
```

Component Design Patterns:  NEEDS REVIEW
Testing Coverage:           CRITICAL
Accessibility Debt:         MEDIUM
Estimated Effort:           13 SP REALISTIC
```

**Risk Areas:**
1. **Scope Creep:** 13 SP is ambitious for UI modernization
   - Mitigation: Clear component inventory upfront
   - Clear definition of "modernized"
   - Phase approach (high-impact first)

2. **Breaking Changes:** Refactored components could break integrations
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive component testing (E2E)
   - API contracts remain stable
   - Backward compatibility for data models

3. **Accessibility:** Often overlooked in UI updates
   - Requirement: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
   - Testing: axe-core automated + manual review
   - Effort: ~15-20% of feature scope

**Detailed Assessment:**
- Current Store frontend: Functional but dated
- Tailwind CSS: Good choice (utility-first, DRY, maintainable)
- Component library: Opportunity to create reusable system
- Performance: Tailwind + Vue.js = excellent performance
- Theming: Runtime tenant-specific theming possible (Issue #16)

**Recommendation:**
✅ **APPROVE with Conditions:**
- Allocate 2 SP for accessibility review/fixes
- Define "done" criteria upfront (component inventory)
- Daily standup with @Frontend to catch scope changes
- Phase approach: Core components week 1, enhancements week 2

### **Issue #15: P0.6 EU E-Commerce Legal Compliance (21 SP)** ⚠️ COMPLEX
**Owner:** @ProductOwner (Specification), @Backend + @Frontend (Implementation)  
**Status:** Scheduled Post-Sprint (Phase 1)  

**Architect Assessment:**
```
Architecture Impact:        MEDIUM-HIGH (new domain logic)
Service Boundary Impact:    HIGH (affects multiple services)
API Contract Changes:       HIGH (new endpoints needed)
Data Model Changes:         MEDIUM (new fields required)
Risk Level:                 🟡 MEDIUM (regulatory compliance)
Complexity:                 HIGH (9 sub-issues identified)
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**Affected Services:**
1. **Catalog Service**
   - Product price display requirements (PAngV compliance)
   - Shipping cost transparency (PAngV)
   - Impact: New fields in Product aggregate

2. **Order Service** (New/Enhanced)
   - 14-day withdrawal right implementation (VVVG)
   - Invoice generation & archival (10-year requirement)
   - Payment terms for B2B (Net 30/60/90)
   - B2B VAT-ID validation (reverse charge)
   - Impact: New Order aggregate fields, new business logic

3. **Customer Service**
   - B2C vs B2B account types
   - VAT-ID storage and validation
   - Tax handling differences
   - Impact: New Customer aggregate fields

4. **Frontend Service**
   - Legal acceptance checkboxes (Impressum, Privacy, Terms)
   - Tax information display (B2C vs B2B)
   - Withdrawal process workflow
   - Impact: New UI components, business logic

**API Contracts - Changes Needed:**
```
POST /api/products → Add fields:
- priceIncludingTax (float)
- taxPercentage (float)
- shippingCost (float)

POST /api/orders → Add fields:
- orderType: enum (B2C | B2B)
- vatId: string (optional, B2B only)
- paymentTerms: enum (Immediate | Net30 | Net60 | Net90)
- invoiceNumber: string (generated)
- invoiceArchiveDate: datetime

POST /api/customers → Add fields:
- accountType: enum (B2C | B2B)
- vatId: string
- companyName: string
- taxNumber: string
```

**TechLead Assessment:**
```
Code Complexity:            HIGH (business rules)
Test Coverage Needed:       80%+ (critical functionality)
Integration Testing:        CRITICAL (service coordination)
Regulatory Risk:            HIGH (must be correct)
Documentation Effort:       SIGNIFICANT
```

**Implementation Concerns:**
1. **Data Consistency:** VAT-ID validation must be consistent across calls
   - Solution: Validate at API Gateway level + service level (defense in depth)
   - Testing: Multiple invalid inputs per validation rule

2. **Event Broadcasting:** New events for compliance-related changes
   - New Events: `OrderCreatedWithCompliance`, `CustomerUpgradedToB2B`
   - Subscribers: Logging, Email, Invoice systems
   - Risk: Event versioning complexity

3. **Regulatory Compliance Verification:**
   - No shortcuts - must be legally reviewed
   - @Legal must sign off on implementation
   - Documentation requirements clear
   - Audit trail for compliance changes

4. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Existing API clients (admin, store) must continue working
   - New compliance fields optional where possible
   - Clear API versioning strategy needed

**Service Communication Impact:**
- Catalog → Order (product tax info lookup)
- Customer → Order (VAT validation)
- Order → Invoice system (10-year archival)
- Multiple services = distributed transaction needs (Saga pattern)

**Recommendation:**
✅ **APPROVE for Phase 1 Planning** (not Sprint 1 execution)
- Finalize specifications now (Issue #15 = planning phase, 21 SP)
- Implementation starts Sprint 2 (after dependencies stabilize)
- @Legal review gate mandatory before coding
- Split into smaller issues per compliance requirement (5 SP each)
