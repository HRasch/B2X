- **Reference**: [copilot-instructions-ai-specialist.md](../../../.github/copilot-instructions.md)

#### 4. **Process Controller ↔ Scrum Master**
- **Trigger**: Every sprint completion
- **Coordination**:
  - Process Controller: Track metrics, identify cost increases
  - Scrum Master: Retrospectives, process optimization
  - All Agents: Provide metrics input
- **Alert Threshold**: Cost increase >15% → trigger optimization sprint
- **Weekly Report**: Metrics dashboard, cost analysis, recommendations
- **Escalation**: Critical cost spike (>$150/day) → @scrum-master immediately
