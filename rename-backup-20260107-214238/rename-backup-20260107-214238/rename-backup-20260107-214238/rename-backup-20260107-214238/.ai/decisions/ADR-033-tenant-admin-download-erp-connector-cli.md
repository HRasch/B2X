# ADR-033: Tenant-Admin Download for ERP-Connector and Administration-CLI Coupled to CLI

**Status:** Approved  
**Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Context:** B2X multi-tenant SaaS platform  
**Decision Authors:** @Architect, @Backend, @Security, @DevOps, @TechLead, @ProductOwner, @Legal, @Support, @DocMaintainer

## Problem

Following the CLI architecture split in ADR-031, where the administration CLI is designed to be distributable to tenant administrators, we need to decide whether to:

1. **Provide downloadable ERP-connector** to tenant-admins for on-premises ERP integration
2. **Couple the administration-CLI** with ERP-connector functionality for unified tenant management

### Current State
- ERP integrations are handled via the ERP-connector (KB-021)
- ERP-connector is a .NET Framework 4.8 console application running on-premises
- Administration CLI (from ADR-031) provides tenant-scoped operations
- No current mechanism for tenant-admins to download or manage ERP components

### Key Concerns
- **Security:** ERP-connector requires access to sensitive ERP data and systems
- **Coupling:** Should administration CLI include ERP management commands?
- **Multi-tenancy:** How to ensure tenant isolation in downloadable components?
- **Technical Feasibility:** Distribution, versioning, and support implications

### Business Context
- Tenant-admins need to integrate their ERP systems with B2X
- Current process requires manual ERP-connector setup and configuration
- Opportunity to simplify onboarding by providing downloadable tools
- Risk of exposing internal infrastructure or compromising security

---

## Decision Drivers

### Security Considerations
- ERP-connector accesses sensitive business data (customers, orders, inventory)
- Must prevent cross-tenant data leakage
- Authentication must be tenant-scoped and auditable
- Distribution must follow security guidelines (security.instructions.md)

### Coupling Analysis
- Administration CLI is tenant-focused (users, catalogs, tenant config)
- ERP-connector is integration-focused (data synchronization, API bridging)
- Coupling could simplify deployment but increase complexity
- Separation maintains clear boundaries but requires separate tooling

### Multi-Tenancy Requirements
- Each tenant's ERP-connector must be isolated
- Configuration must be tenant-specific
- No shared state between tenant deployments
- Audit logging must track tenant-specific operations

### Technical Feasibility
- ERP-connector is .NET Framework 4.8 (Windows-only)
- Administration CLI is .NET 10 cross-platform
- Distribution via NuGet packages
- Version compatibility and update management

### User Experience
- Simplify tenant onboarding process
- Reduce support burden
- Provide unified tooling for tenant administration
- Enable self-service ERP setup

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Coupled Administration CLI with ERP-Connector Download
**Provide administration CLI that includes ERP-connector download and management commands**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Unified tooling for tenant administration and ERP integration
- ✅ Simplified deployment (single CLI handles both concerns)
- ✅ Easier user experience (one tool to learn)
- ✅ Consistent authentication and configuration

**Cons:**
- ❌ Increased coupling between administration and integration concerns
- ❌ Larger distribution package with ERP-specific dependencies
- ❌ Potential security risks if ERP commands access sensitive data inappropriately
- ❌ Versioning complexity (CLI and ERP-connector may have different release cycles)

**Technical Feasibility:** Medium - Requires extending administration CLI with ERP commands and download functionality

### Option 2: Separate ERP-Connector Download Only
**Provide standalone ERP-connector download, keep administration CLI separate**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (administration vs. integration)
- ✅ Smaller, focused administration CLI
- ✅ Independent versioning and deployment
- ✅ Reduced security surface for administration CLI

**Cons:**
- ❌ Tenant-admins need multiple tools for complete setup
- ❌ More complex user experience (separate installations)
- ❌ Potential configuration inconsistencies between tools
- ❌ Increased support overhead for tool coordination

**Technical Feasibility:** High - ERP-connector already exists as standalone component

### Option 3: ERP-Connector Remains Internal Only
**Do not provide downloadable ERP-connector, require professional services setup**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Maximum security (no external distribution of ERP access)
- ✅ Controlled deployment and configuration
- ✅ Professional services revenue opportunity
- ✅ Simplified support (internal team handles all setups)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Poor user experience (manual setup required)
- ❌ Higher barrier to entry for tenants
- ❌ Increased operational overhead
- ❌ Limits scalability and self-service capabilities

**Technical Feasibility:** High - No additional development required

## Decision

**Provide downloadable ERP-connector coupled with administration CLI for tenant-admins**

### Rationale
- **Security:** Tenant-scoped authentication and isolation can be enforced
- **User Experience:** Unified tooling significantly simplifies tenant onboarding
- **Business Value:** Enables self-service ERP integration, reducing support costs
- **Technical Feasibility:** Building on existing ADR-031 split, coupling is manageable

### Implementation Approach
1. **Extend Administration CLI** with ERP-connector download commands
2. **Tenant-Scoped Distribution** - CLI downloads tenant-specific ERP-connector builds
3. **Secure Download Mechanism** - Authenticated, version-controlled downloads
4. **Configuration Coupling** - Administration CLI can configure downloaded ERP-connector

### Key Requirements
- ERP-connector downloads are authenticated with tenant API keys
- Downloaded ERP-connector is pre-configured for the tenant
- Administration CLI includes commands for ERP-connector lifecycle management
- All operations are audited and tenant-isolated

## Proposed Architecture

```
Administration CLI (Downloadable to Tenants)
├── Core Commands (from ADR-031)
│   ├── tenant create/update
│   ├── user management
│   └── catalog operations
│
├── ERP Integration Commands (New)
│   ├── erp download-connector
│   ├── erp configure-connector
│   ├── erp start-connector
│   ├── erp status-connector
│   └── erp update-connector
│
└── Download Service (Internal)
    ├── Tenant-Authenticated Downloads
    ├── Version Management
    └── Configuration Injection
```

### Download Flow
```bash
# Tenant admin downloads and configures ERP-connector
B2X erp download-connector --version latest
B2X erp configure-connector --erp-type enventa --connection-string "..."
B2X erp start-connector --background
```

### Security Model
- Downloads require valid tenant API key
- ERP-connector is signed and version-controlled
- Configuration includes tenant-specific isolation parameters
- All operations logged for audit compliance

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Tenant API key required for all ERP operations
- ✅ Downloads authenticated against tenant identity
- ✅ No cross-tenant access possible
- ✅ Audit logging for all download and configuration operations

### Data Protection
- ✅ ERP-connector configuration encrypted at rest and in transit
- ✅ HTTPS required for all download communications
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs (masking applied)
- ✅ Certificate pinning for production downloads

### Distribution Security
- ✅ Signed NuGet packages for CLI distribution
- ✅ Signed ERP-connector binaries
- ✅ Version verification before download
- ✅ Tamper detection and integrity checks

### Multi-Tenancy Isolation
- ✅ Each downloaded ERP-connector configured for single tenant
- ✅ Tenant ID embedded in configuration
- ✅ No shared state between tenant deployments
- ✅ Rate limiting per tenant for downloads

---

   - Backward compatibility requirements
   - **Mitigation:** Semantic versioning, automated testing

4. **Support Overhead**
   - Tenant-admins may need help with ERP setup
   - Debugging distributed components
   - **Mitigation:** Enhanced documentation, remote diagnostics
