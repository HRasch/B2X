# ADR-038: Customer Integration Stages Framework

## Status

**Accepted** - Approved by @Architect, @ProductOwner on 2026-01-05

## Context

B2X is a multi-tenant B2B/B2C e-commerce platform with ERP integration capabilities. As we onboard customers, we need a standardized framework that:

1. **Defines clear integration stages** from evaluation to mature production use
2. **Sets expectations** for timelines, deliverables, and success criteria per stage
3. **Enables tracking** of customer progress through the integration journey
4. **Automates stage transitions** via CLI tooling and health checks
5. **Differentiates service tiers** (self-service vs. assisted onboarding)

### Current Gaps

- No formal definition of customer integration stages
- No standardized onboarding checklist
- ERP connector deployment (ADR-033, ADR-034) lacks integration journey context
- Missing success metrics per stage
- No automation for stage progression tracking

### Relationship to ADR-037

ADR-037 defines **internal development lifecycle stages** (Alpha → Stable → EOL).  
This ADR defines **customer-facing integration stages** (Evaluate → Optimize).

## Decision

We will implement a **4-stage Customer Integration Framework** with defined sub-stages, success criteria, and automation support.

## Automation & Tooling

### Stage Tracking

```yaml
# .ai/templates/customer-integration-tracker.yml
customer:
  name: "Customer Corp"
  tenant_id: "customer-corp"
  tier: enterprise
  start_date: "2026-01-15"
  target_go_live: "2026-03-01"

stages:
  evaluate:
    status: complete
    started: "2025-12-01"
    completed: "2025-12-20"
    
  onboard:
    status: complete
    started: "2026-01-02"
    completed: "2026-01-14"
    
  integrate:
    status: in_progress
    started: "2026-01-15"
    current_substage: "3.5 CUSTOMER SYNC"
    blockers: []
    
  optimize:
    status: pending
```

### Health Check Commands

```bash
# Check overall integration status
B2X integration status --tenant customer-corp

# Detailed stage report
B2X integration report --tenant customer-corp --format detailed

# Automated readiness checks
B2X integration check-readiness \
  --tenant customer-corp \
  --stage integrate
```

### Notifications & Alerts

- Stage completion notifications (email, webhook)
- Blocker alerts to customer success team
- Automated follow-up reminders
- SLA breach warnings

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation (Week 1)
- [x] Create ADR-038 (this document)
- [ ] Update DOCUMENT_REGISTRY.md
- [ ] Create customer-facing integration guide

### Phase 2: Checklists & Templates (Week 2)
- [ ] Create `.ai/templates/customer-integration-tracker.yml`
- [ ] Create onboarding checklist template
- [ ] Create integration checklist template
- [ ] Define stage transition criteria

### Phase 3: CLI Commands (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement `B2X trial create`
- [ ] Implement `B2X tenant verify-readiness`
- [ ] Implement `B2X integration status`
- [ ] Implement `B2X integration report`

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Tracking (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Customer integration progress dashboard (Admin)
- [ ] Stage progression automation
- [ ] Notification system for stage transitions
- [ ] Success metrics tracking

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Clear Expectations**: Customers understand the journey and timelines
2. **Predictable Delivery**: Standardized stages enable accurate planning
3. **Quality Assurance**: Checklists ensure nothing is missed
4. **Scalable Onboarding**: Self-service tier reduces support burden
5. **Measurable Success**: Metrics per stage enable continuous improvement

### Negative

1. **Rigidity**: Some customers may not fit standard stages
2. **Overhead**: Tracking and checklists require maintenance
3. **Complexity**: Multiple tiers require different processes

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Stage skipping | Enforce prerequisites via tooling |
| Stalled integrations | Automated alerts, CSM follow-up |
| Tier mismatch | Pre-sales assessment, tier upgrades |
| Timeline overruns | Buffer time, escalation paths |

---

## Alternatives Considered

### A. No Formal Stages
- **Pros**: Flexibility, less overhead
- **Cons**: Inconsistent experience, unpredictable timelines
- **Decision**: Rejected — standardization needed for scale

### B. More Granular Stages (6+)
- **Pros**: Fine-grained tracking
- **Cons**: Complexity, overhead
- **Decision**: Rejected — 4 stages with sub-stages provides balance

### C. Single Process for All Tiers
- **Pros**: Simpler to manage
- **Cons**: Over-serves SMB, under-serves enterprise
- **Decision**: Rejected — tiered approach matches customer needs
