## Essential Security Rules

### 1. Use a Strong Password

✅ **DO:**
- Mix uppercase and lowercase letters: `MyPassword`
- Include numbers: `MyPassword123`
- Add special characters: `MyPassword123!`
- Use at least 8 characters

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use your name or birthday
- Use common words like "password"
- Use the same password everywhere
- Share your password with anyone

### 2. Never Share Your Password

**Your password should only be known by you!**

Who should NOT have your password:
- ❌ Friends and family
- ❌ B2X employees (they'll never ask!)
- ❌ Your spouse or partner
- ❌ Customer support staff

**Exception:** Password managers (LastPass, 1Password) - they're encrypted and secure.

### 3. Be Careful on Public Computers

**On a public computer (library, hotel, office):**
1. ❌ Don't use "Keep me logged in"
2. ❌ Don't save your password
3. ✅ Always click "Log Out" when done
4. ✅ Close the browser window completely

**At home (your computer):**
- ✅ Safer to use "Keep me logged in"

### 4. Only Use Official B2X

✅ **SAFE:**
- Website: `https://www.B2X.com`
- Official mobile app (iOS or Android)
- Official B2X emails (from `@B2X.com`)

❌ **NOT SAFE:**
- Websites that look like B2X but have different URL
- Unknown apps claiming to be B2X
- Emails asking you to "confirm your password"

### 5. Verify Emails Are Real

**Scammers send fake emails!** Here's how to spot them:

✅ **Real B2X emails:**
- Come from `@B2X.com` or `noreply@B2X.com`
- Address you as "Dear [Your Name]"
- Are about things you did (orders, login, etc.)

❌ **Fake emails:**
- Come from `@gmail.com` or unknown domains
- Say "Dear Customer" (not your name)
- Ask you to "verify your account" or "confirm payment"
- Include suspicious links
- Ask for your password (B2X NEVER asks this!)

**When in doubt:** Go directly to B2X.com instead of clicking email links.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### What is 2FA?

Two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer:
1. Something you know: **Your password**
2. Something you have: **Your phone**

### How It Works

```
You log in with email & password
        ↓
B2X sends a code to your phone
        ↓
You enter the code
        ↓
You're logged in! ✓
```

Even if someone steals your password, they can't log in without your phone!

### How to Enable 2FA

1. Log in to your account
2. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
3. Click **"Enable Two-Factor Authentication"**
4. Choose delivery method:
   - **SMS (Text Message)** - Code sent to your phone via text
   - **Authenticator App** - Use Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator
5. Follow the setup steps
6. Save backup codes in a safe place!
7. Click **"Enable"**

### Using 2FA When Logging In

**With SMS:**
1. Enter email and password
2. Receive text with 6-digit code
3. Enter the code on login page
4. You're in!

**With Authenticator App:**
1. Enter email and password
2. Open Google Authenticator or Authy app
3. Find B2X code (changes every 30 seconds)
4. Enter the code on login page
5. You're in!

### Backup Codes

When you enable 2FA, you get backup codes. **Save them somewhere safe!**

**Why?** If you lose your phone, you can use backup codes to log in.

**Where to store:**
- ✅ Write on paper in a safe
- ✅ Encrypted password manager
- ❌ Not in your email
