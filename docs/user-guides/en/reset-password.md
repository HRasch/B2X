## Password Tips

### What Makes a Good Password?

✅ **GOOD:**
- `Summer@Paris2025`
- `Blue#Mountains123`
- `Coffee&Cake!456`

❌ **POOR:**
- `password123` (too common)
- `12345678` (only numbers)
- `ABCDEFGH` (only uppercase)
- `myname` (too simple)

### How to Remember Your Password

1. **Use a phrase**: Think of a memorable sentence
   - Sentence: "I love coffee at 7 AM"
   - Password: `Ilca7AM!`

2. **Use a pattern**: Keyboard pattern + numbers
   - Pattern: `QwErTy2025!`

3. **Use a password manager**: Tools like LastPass or 1Password securely store passwords

## Troubleshooting

### "Email Not Found"

**What does this mean?**  
No B2X account exists with that email.

**How to fix:**
1. Check spelling of email
2. Try a different email you might have used
3. [Create a new account](./getting-started.md) if you don't have one yet

### "Reset Link Expired"

**What does this mean?**  
The reset link only works for 1 hour. You waited too long.

**How to fix:**
1. Go back to [password reset page](https://www.B2X.com/forgot-password)
2. Enter your email again
3. Click on the new link

### "Didn't Receive Email"

**Check these places:**
1. ✓ Check Spam folder
2. ✓ Check Promotions folder (Gmail)
3. ✓ Check Junk folder (Outlook)
4. ✓ Wait 5 minutes (emails can be slow)
5. ✓ Check spelling of your email address

**Still nothing?**
1. Go back to reset page
2. Enter your email again
3. Check a different email folder

### "Password Doesn't Meet Requirements"

**What does this mean?**  
Your password is missing something.

**Requirements:**
- ✓ At least 8 characters long
- ✓ At least one UPPERCASE letter (A-Z)
