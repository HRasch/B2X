# GitHub PR Setup & Configuration

**Instructions for setting up GitHub to enforce the PR workflow**

## 📋 GitHub Branch Protection Rules

### Enable for `main` branch

**Location**: Repository Settings → Branches → Add Rule for `main`

```yaml
Rule Configuration:
├── Pattern: main
├── Require a pull request before merging: ✅ TRUE
│   ├── Require approvals: ✅ TRUE
│   │   └── Required number of approvals: 3 (Lead Dev + Architecture + Code Owner)
│   ├── Dismiss stale pull request approvals: ✅ TRUE
│   ├── Require code owner review: ✅ TRUE (if CODEOWNERS file exists)
│   └── Require conversation resolution: ✅ TRUE
│
├── Require status checks to pass before merging: ✅ TRUE
│   ├── Required status checks:
│   │   ├── ✅ build (GitHub Actions)
│   │   ├── ✅ test (GitHub Actions)
│   │   ├── ✅ coverage (GitHub Actions)
│   │   ├── ✅ code-style (GitHub Actions)
│   │   └── ✅ security-scan (GitHub Actions)
│   └── Require branches to be up to date: ✅ TRUE
│
├── Require commits to be signed: ✅ FALSE (optional, can enable later)
│
├── Restrict who can push to matching branches: ✅ FALSE (team can force-push if needed)
│
└── Allow force pushes: ✅ FALSE (prevent accidental overwrites)
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Cannot merge without 3 approvals
- ✅ All checks must pass (build, test, coverage)
- ✅ Conversations must be resolved
- ✅ PR title/description required

## 🤖 GitHub Actions Workflows

### Build & Test Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`

```yaml
