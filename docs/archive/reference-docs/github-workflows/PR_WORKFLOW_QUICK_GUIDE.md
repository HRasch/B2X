## ❌ PR Rejected - What to Do

**If GitHub blocks PR**:

```
❌ Build failed      → Fix compilation errors
❌ Tests failed      → Fix failing tests
❌ Coverage too low  → Write more tests
❌ Secrets detected  → Remove hardcoded values
❌ Style violations  → Run dotnet format
```

**For each issue**:
1. Read the error message
2. Fix in your code
3. Re-push (`git push`)
4. Automated checks re-run
5. Loop until all green ✅
