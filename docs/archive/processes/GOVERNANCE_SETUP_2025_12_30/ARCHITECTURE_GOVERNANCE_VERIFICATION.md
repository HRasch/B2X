## 🎯 Governance Model Verification

### Authority Matrix ✅

**@software-architect EXCLUSIVE CONTROL**:
- [x] SOFTWARE_DEFINITION.md (scope, vision, constraints)
- [x] DESIGN_DECISIONS.md (architectural decisions, ADRs)
- [x] ESTIMATIONS_AND_CAPACITY.md (projections, costs, timelines)
- [x] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**All other agents**: 
- [x] Read-only access to all architecture docs
- [x] Cannot modify controlled documents
- [x] Request changes through formal process

### Change Timing ✅

**Estimations**:
- [x] Change ONLY during issue review when development starts
- [x] Locked after development begins (no mid-sprint changes)
- [x] Require @software-architect approval
- [x] Must be logged in commit message

**Design Decisions**:
- [x] Require ADR BEFORE implementation starts
- [x] Require @tech-lead review
- [x] NOT allowed: Making changes without documented decision
- [x] NOT allowed: Changing after code written

**Scope**:
- [x] Change ONLY during quarterly reviews
- [x] Require @product-owner confirmation
- [x] Require rationale documentation
- [x] NOT allowed: Undocumented scope creep

### Enforcement by @process-assistant ✅

**Daily Procedures**:
- [x] Monitor commits to architecture docs
- [x] Verify only @software-architect modifies restricted files
- [x] Check ADR links in PRs affecting architecture
- [x] Log any violations

**Weekly Procedures**:
- [x] Review document currency
- [x] Verify design decisions being followed in code
- [x] Flag scope violations
- [x] Check compliance metrics

**Monthly Procedures**:
- [x] Review new ADRs for completeness
- [x] Assess estimations accuracy against actuals
- [x] Generate compliance report
- [x] Identify process improvements

**Quarterly Procedures**:
- [x] Full SOFTWARE_DEFINITION.md review
- [x] Estimations update with learnings
- [x] Design decisions effectiveness assessment
- [x] Update framework with improvements
