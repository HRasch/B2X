## ❌ NEVER CREATE IN PROJECT ROOT

```
Wrong:
  B2Connect/ISSUE_30_*.md
  B2Connect/PHASE_3_*.md
  B2Connect/SPRINT_*.md
```

---

## ✅ ALWAYS UPDATE INDEX

When creating new issue doc in `collaborate/sprint/1/execution/`:

```bash
# Add to index.md:
- [Issue #30: Description](./ISSUE_30_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
```
