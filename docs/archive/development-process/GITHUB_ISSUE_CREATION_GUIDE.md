Effort: 12 hours | Sprint: Sprint 1

User Story

including VAT, so that I comply with PAngV and customers know 
actual cost before checkout.

Acceptance Criteria
✓ Product listing displays price as "€99,99 inkl. MwSt"
✓ Product detail page shows VAT breakdown
✓ Cart displays "Subtotal + VAT = Total"
✓ Checkout confirms final price before payment
✓ Invoice shows VAT breakdown per line item
... (more criteria)

Subtasks
☐ Create PriceCalculationService (backend)
☐ Implement VAT rate lookup per country/product
☐ Update ProductCard component to show VAT
... (more subtasks)

Labels: P0.6, legal, pricing, backend, sprint-1
```

## 🔄 If Issues Already Exist

If you already created some of these issues, the script will fail with:
```
Error: Validation Failed: {"resource":"Issue","field":"title","code":"custom","message":"is invalid"}
```

### Solution:
1. **Delete existing issues** (if desired):
   ```bash
   gh issue delete <issue-number>
   ```

2. **Or modify script** to check for duplicates:
   ```bash
   # Add before gh issue create:
   if gh issue list --label "P0.6" | grep -q "US-001"; then
     echo "Issue already exists, skipping..."
     continue
   fi
   ```

---

## 📝 Customization

### To Modify Issues Before Creation:

Edit `CREATE_BACKLOG_ISSUES.sh`:

```bash
# Change sprint assignment
--label "P0.6,legal,pricing,backend,sprint-1"
# ↓
--label "P0.6,legal,pricing,backend,sprint-2"

# Change effort
**Effort:** 12 hours | **Sprint:** Sprint 1
# ↓
**Effort:** 16 hours | **Sprint:** Sprint 2

# Add/remove subtasks
- [ ] Create PriceCalculationService (backend)
- [ ] ...
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "gh: command not found"
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Then authenticate
gh auth login
```

### Issue: "Unauthorized: Requires push access"
```bash
# Re-authenticate with proper permissions
gh auth login
# → Choose: Generate new GitHub token
# → Select scopes: repo, workflow
```

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
```bash
# GitHub API rate limit: 60 requests/hour (unauthenticated)
