## 📋 PR Workflow: The 5 Steps

### Step 1: Pre-PR (Local)
```bash
dotnet build B2Connect.slnx  # ✅ Must compile
dotnet test B2Connect.slnx   # ✅ All pass
# Coverage >= 80%, no secrets, issue #XXX linked
```

### Step 2: Open PR
- Title: `[TYPE](#scope): DESCRIPTION (#ISSUE)`
- Description: Use template
- Link issue: "Closes #30"

### Step 3: GitHub Checks
- Build runs automatically ✅
- Tests run automatically ✅
- Coverage calculated ✅
- Code style checked ✅
- Security scan ✅

### Step 4: 3-Role Review
```
Lead Dev Review   → Code quality OK? (< 24h SLA)
Architecture      → Design sound? (< 24h SLA, if needed)
Code Owner        → Business logic? (< 24h SLA)
```

### Step 5: Merge
```
✅ All 3 approvals received
✅ QA tested in staging
✅ GitHub checks pass
→ Squash & Merge
→ Auto-deploy to production
```

A: Fix the issue (build, test, coverage, secrets), re-push, checks re-run.

**Q: What if I disagree with feedback?**  
A: Reply respectfully, explain reasoning with evidence, let reviewer decide.

**Q: Can I merge with 2 approvals instead of 3?**  
A: No, branch protection requires all 3.

**Q: What if code owner isn't available?**  
A: Tech Lead can override if needed (documented escalation).
