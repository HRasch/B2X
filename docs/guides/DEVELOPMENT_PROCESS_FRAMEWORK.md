## 🎯 Overview & Principles

### Core Principles

```
1. COLLABORATIVE: All roles work together, no silos
2. TRANSPARENT: Every change marked and traceable
3. QUALITY-FIRST: Testing before commit
4. ASYNC-CAPABLE: Support requests answered by other roles
5. CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT: Retrospectives drive process evolution
6. CRITICAL-ONLY-STOP: Continue unless critical issue blocks
7. DOCUMENTED: Every API/Interface documented before merge
```

### Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero untracked AI agent changes
- ✅ 100% inter-role question resolution (avg 24h)
- ✅ 80%+ code coverage on all features
- ✅ 100% API/Interface documentation
- ✅ <5 critical issues per sprint
- ✅ Retrospectives drive 10%+ automation gain/sprint
- ✅ **100% build success before phase transitions**
- ✅ **100% DoR compliance (no work without DoR)**
- ✅ **Zero code changes outside responsible developer**
- ✅ **100% QA bugs returned to original developer**

---

## 📋 Definition of Ready (DoR)

### What is Definition of Ready?

Every issue **MUST** be marked as "Ready for Development" before ANY developer pulls it from GitHub. This is the **mandatory first step** of the development process.

### DoR Checklist (Before Development Starts)

**Product Owner Responsibility:**
```

## 🏗️ Buildability & Code Compilation Gate

### Core Rule: "Software Must Compile Before Next Phase"

**Every transition to a new development phase requires:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BUILDABILITY IS A MANDATORY GATE                              │
│                                                               │
│ Before Phase Transition:                                     │
│ ✅ Code MUST compile without errors                          │
│ ✅ ALL tests MUST pass                                       │
│ ✅ NO compiler warnings (treat as errors)                    │
│ ✅ Coverage >= 80% (on changed files)                        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Build Gates by Phase

#### Gate: Before Commit
```bash
# MANDATORY: Developer must run BEFORE committing
dotnet build B2Connect.slnx
  → If FAIL: Fix immediately, cannot commit
  → If PASS: Continue to testing
  
dotnet test B2Connect.slnx -v minimal
  → If FAIL: Fix immediately, cannot commit
  → If PASS: Can commit
```

#### Gate: Before Push to GitHub
```bash
# Run full suite locally
dotnet build B2Connect.slnx    # Must succeed
dotnet test B2Connect.slnx --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
  → Coverage report shows >= 80% on changed code
  → If < 80%: Add tests, cannot push
  
# Check for agent changes marked
grep -r "// 🤖" backend/Domain/[Service]/src
  → If agent changes NOT marked: Mark them, cannot push
```

#### Gate: Before PR Merge (CI Pipeline)
```yaml
# GitHub Actions MUST all pass
✅ Build: dotnet build B2Connect.slnx
✅ Test: dotnet test B2Connect.slnx
✅ Coverage: >= 75% (GitHub Actions enforces)
✅ Lint: StyleCop, ESLint (no warnings as errors)
✅ Security: SonarQube scan (no critical issues)

# If ANY fail: PR cannot be merged
# Developer MUST fix and push again
```

#### Gate: Before Staging Deployment
```bash
# Full build on staging environment
dotnet build -c Release B2Connect.slnx
  → If FAIL: Deployment blocked
  
# All integration tests
dotnet test B2Connect.slnx --filter "Category=Integration"
  → If FAIL: Deployment blocked
```

#### Gate: Before Production Deployment
```bash
# Same as staging + production verification
✅ Build successful (Release config)
✅ All tests passing
✅ Smoke tests on staging passed
✅ Product Owner sign-off received
✅ Rollback plan documented
```

### Handling Build Failures

```
Build Fails at Any Gate
    ↓
Responsible Developer Notified (GitHub)
    ↓
Developer Fixes Immediately
    (Max 2h response time)
    ↓
Developer Pushes Fix
    ↓
CI Re-runs Automatically
    ↓
Build Succeeds? → Proceed to Next Phase
Build Fails Again? → Escalate to Lead Developer
    ↓
[Lead Developer assists in root cause]
```

## 👤 Code Ownership & Responsibility

### Principle: "Only Responsible Developer Modifies Code"

**This is a CRITICAL quality rule** to prevent tangled ownership and accountability issues.

### Code Assignment Rules

```
1. ISSUE PULLED BY DEVELOPER
   └─ That developer is the OWNER
   └─ Only that developer modifies the code
   └─ Only that developer fixes bugs found in testing

2. CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK
   └─ Reviewer provides feedback in PR comments
   └─ Reviewer does NOT push changes
   └─ Owner makes changes requested
   └─ Reviewer approves modified code

3. CONCURRENT CHANGES FORBIDDEN
   ❌ Two developers on same feature = NOT ALLOWED
   ❌ Reviewer pushing fixes = NOT ALLOWED
   ❌ QA modifying code = NOT ALLOWED
   ✅ Owner modifies based on feedback only

4. HANDOFF ONLY IF ESSENTIAL
   If owner must hand off (vacation, emergency):
   ├─ Create new issue for handoff
   ├─ Original owner: @john-dev → Current work summary
   ├─ New owner: @jane-dev → Pulls handoff issue
   ├─ Lead Developer: Approves handoff
   └─ Document reason + handoff notes in issue
```

### Code Review Process (No Code Changes by Reviewer)

```
Owner → Pushes PR with Code
        ↓
Lead Developer → Reviews Code
    ├─ Comment: "Use async/await here"
    ├─ Comment: "Add validation for null input"
    ├─ Comment: "Missing unit test for error case"
    └─ Does NOT push changes
        ↓
Owner → Reads feedback
    ├─ Makes code changes requested
    ├─ Adds requested validation
    ├─ Writes missing unit test
    └─ Pushes updated code
        ↓
Lead Developer → Re-reviews
    ├─ Code looks good
    └─ Approves PR
```

### Breaking the Rule: Escalation

**If reviewer finds critical issues that owner won't fix:**

```
Reviewer Rejects PR + Escalates to Lead Developer
    ↓
Lead Developer Contacts Owner
    ├─ Option 1: Owner fixes (preferred)
    ├─ Option 2: Pair programming session
    ├─ Option 3: Issue reassigned to new developer
    └─ Last Resort: Code revert
```

### Responsibility Matrix

| Task | Responsible | Can Assist |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Write code | Owner | None |
| Fix code review feedback | Owner | None |
| Write tests | Owner | QA (test design) |
| Fix test failures | Owner | Lead Dev (strategy) |
| Fix bugs found in QA | Owner | QA (documentation) |
| Fix performance issues | Owner | Architect (design) |
| Merge PR | Lead Developer | None |
| Deploy code | DevOps | Lead Developer |

## 🔀 Pull Request Workflow

### Purpose
Pull requests are the **formal code review gate** before merging to `main`. Every PR must satisfy:
1. **Build gates** (code compiles, tests pass)
2. **Code ownership** (only owner modifies)
3. **Role-based approvals** (3 roles required)
4. **Documentation** (APIs documented)
5. **QA readiness** (testable, no blockers)

## 🎨 Agent-Change Marking System

### Purpose
Clearly distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code for transparency and accountability.

### How to Mark Agent Changes

#### Rule 1: Code Comments (Inline)
```csharp
// 🤖 AGENT-GENERATED: Price calculation service using IServiceProvider pattern
public class PriceCalculationService : IPriceCalculationService
{
    // 🤖 AGENT: Inject Redis cache via DI
    private readonly IDistributedCache _cache;
    
    // 🤖 AGENT: Custom business logic comment
    public async Task<decimal> CalculateVatAmount(decimal netAmount, string countryCode)
    {
        // Human: We need this for German B2B customers
        if (countryCode == "DE")
        {
            // 🤖 AGENT: Standard VAT calculation (19% for Germany)
            return netAmount * 0.19m;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Rule 2: Documentation Comments (XML Doc)
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// 🤖 AGENT-GENERATED: Validates VAT ID against VIES API
/// 
/// This service was auto-generated with human review.
/// Contact: Lead Developer for modifications
/// </summary>
public interface IVatIdValidationService
{
    Task<bool> ValidateAsync(string vatId, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

#### Rule 3: Test Methods
```csharp
public class PriceCalculationTests
{
    /// <summary>
    /// 🤖 AGENT-GENERATED: Test for standard VAT calculation
    /// </summary>
    [Fact]
    public async Task CalculateVat_GermanCustomer_Returns19Percent()
    {
        // Arrange
        var service = new PriceCalculationService(_cache);
        
        // Act
        var result = await service.CalculateVatAmount(100m, "DE");
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(19m, result);
    }
}
```

#### Rule 4: Markdown Documentation
```markdown

## 🐛 QA Bug Loop & Issue Reporting

### Rule: "QA Finds Bugs → Returns to Developer"

When QA finds bugs during testing, they do NOT fix the code. They report the issue back to the **original responsible developer**.

### Problem Statement
- Features often block on unclear requirements
- Developers wait 5+ days for architect feedback
- No formal "ask for help" mechanism

### Solution: Question & Answer Board

#### Question Template

```markdown
## [QUESTION] Can I use Strategy Pattern here?

**From**: Backend Developer (@john-dev)  
**To**: Software Architect (@architect)  
**Issue**: #30 (Price Calculation)  
**Priority**: Medium (blocks dev, not critical)  
**Created**: 29. Dezember 2025, 10:30 CET  

### Context
Implementing VAT calculation with multiple country rules.

### Question
Should I use Strategy pattern (separate class per country) 
or a single service with if/else logic?

### What I've Tried
- Reviewed existing patterns in Catalog service
- Looked at CQRS handlers for inspiration

### Acceptance Criteria for Answer
- [ ] Recommended pattern explained
- [ ] Code example provided
- [ ] Performance implications noted
- [ ] Refactoring risk assessed

---

**Status**: ⏳ Waiting (SLA: 4 business hours)  
**Answered By**: [Will be filled by responder]  
**Resolution Time**: [Will be calculated]
```

#### Response Template

```markdown
## ✅ ANSWER: Strategy Pattern Recommended

**From**: Software Architect (@architect)  
**Response Time**: 2h 15m (SLA: 4h ✅)  

### Recommendation
Use **Strategy Pattern** with factory method.

### Code Example
[Example code provided]

### Rationale
1. Extensible for new countries
2. Testable (mock each strategy)
3. Follows DDD principle (bounded contexts by country)
4. Performance: No measurable impact (< 1ms per call)

### Implementation Steps
1. Create IVatStrategy interface
2. Implement per-country strategy
3. Register in DI with factory
4. Add unit tests (5 per strategy)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Developer implements
- [ ] Lead Dev reviews
- [ ] QA tests all countries
- [ ] Closes this question

## 🛡️ Quality Gates & Testing Requirements

### Gate 0: Definition of Ready (Before Code Starts)

```
✅ Issue pulled from GitHub with status: "ready-for-dev"
✅ Acceptance criteria clear
✅ Dependencies documented & resolved
✅ Test scenarios defined
✅ Story points assigned
✅ Architecture (if new pattern) documented
✅ Developer assigned to self in GitHub
```

### Gate 1: Pre-Commit (Developer Machine)

```bash
# MANDATORY: Run before ANY commit
dotnet build B2Connect.slnx
  → If FAIL: Fix immediately, cannot commit
  
dotnet test B2Connect.slnx -v minimal
  → If FAIL: Fix immediately, cannot commit

# Code quality check
npm run lint (frontend)
dotnet format (backend)

# Check for agent changes marked
grep -r "// 🤖" backend/Domain/[Service]/src
  → All agent changes must be marked
```

### Gate 2: Pre-Push (Local Verification)

```bash
# Frontend coverage
cd Frontend/Store && npm run test -- --coverage

# Backend coverage
dotnet test B2Connect.slnx --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
# Must show: >= 80% for new code
```

### Gate 3: CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Build: dotnet build B2Connect.slnx
- Test: dotnet test B2Connect.slnx
- Coverage Report: Show coverage per service
- Security: SonarQube analysis
- Lint: StyleCop + ESLint
- Documentation: Check API docs exist

# FAIL if:
- Coverage < 75% for changed files
- Build warnings > 0 (treat as error)
- Security issues found
- No API documentation
```

## 📖 Documentation & API Standards

### Mandatory Documentation Before Merge

#### 1. API Endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI)

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// 🤖 AGENT-GENERATED: Get product pricing with VAT
/// </summary>
/// <param name="productId">SKU of the product</param>
/// <param name="countryCode">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (e.g., "DE")</param>
/// <returns>Pricing including VAT breakdown</returns>
/// <response code="200">Price calculated successfully</response>
/// <response code="404">Product not found</response>
/// <response code="400">Invalid country code</response>
[HttpGet("/api/products/{productId}/pricing")]
public async Task<GetProductPricingResponse> GetPricing(
    [FromRoute] string productId,
    [FromQuery] string countryCode,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

#### 2. Service Interfaces

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// 🤖 AGENT-GENERATED: Calculates product prices with VAT
/// 
/// Implementation Pattern: Wolverine Service
/// Issue: #30 (Price Calculation)
/// 
/// Example Usage:
/// <code>
/// var priceService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IPriceCalculationService>();
/// var result = await priceService.CalculatePriceAsync(productId, "DE");
/// // Returns: { NetAmount: 100m, VatAmount: 19m, GrossAmount: 119m }
/// </code>
/// </summary>
public interface IPriceCalculationService
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Calculate price including VAT for product in specific country
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="productId">Unique product identifier (SKU)</param>
    /// <param name="countryCode">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code</param>
    /// <param name="cancellationToken">Cancellation token</param>
    /// <returns>Price breakdown (net, VAT, gross)</returns>
    /// <exception cref="InvalidOperationException">Product not found</exception>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentException">Invalid country code</exception>
    Task<PriceCalculationResult> CalculatePriceAsync(
        string productId,
        string countryCode,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

#### 3. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

```markdown
## ADR: Why Strategy Pattern for VAT Calculation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 29. Dezember 2025  
**Author**: Software Architect  
**Issue**: #30

### Problem
VAT rates vary by country (Germany 19%, UK 20%, EU average 17%).
Need extensible, testable approach.

### Options Considered
1. ❌ If/else chains → Not extensible, hard to test
2. ✅ Strategy Pattern → Extensible, DDD-aligned
3. ❌ Database lookup → Too slow, maintenance overhead

### Decision
Implement Strategy Pattern with factory method.

### Consequences
- ✅ New countries addable without code changes
- ✅ Each country independently testable
- ✅ Follows DDD principle (country = bounded context)
- ❌ Slight performance overhead (negligible: < 1ms)

### Reference
- Code: backend/Domain/Catalog/src/Services/VatStrategy/
- Tests: backend/Domain/Catalog/tests/VatStrategyTests.cs
```

#### 4. Changelog Entry

```markdown
## Version 1.2.0 (Released 29. Dezember 2025)

### New Features
- ✨ **Price Calculation with VAT** (#30)
  - GET /api/products/{id}/pricing
  - Supports all EU countries
  - Caching with Redis

- ✨ **VAT ID Validation** (#31)
  - POST /api/validate/vat-id
  - VIES API integration
  - Rate-limiting (100 req/min)
  - Contact: Jane (Backend Dev)

### Breaking Changes
- 🔴 Removed legacy `GetPriceAsync()` endpoint
  - Use `/api/products/{id}/pricing` instead
  - Deprecated on: 15. Dezember 2025
  - Removed on: 29. Dezember 2025

### Bug Fixes
- 🐛 Fixed decimal separator for German locale (#29)
  - Was: 19.99 (wrong format)
  - Now: 19,99 (correct German format)
```

### Documentation Checklist (Before PR)
