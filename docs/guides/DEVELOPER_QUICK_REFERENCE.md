## 🚀 The 5-Phase Development Process

### Phase 0️⃣ - PULL DoR ISSUE (Day 0)
```
GitHub → Filter: status:ready-for-dev
         Read: Acceptance criteria
         Check: Dependencies resolved
         Assign: To yourself
         Status: "in-progress"
         ✅ ONLY THEN START CODING
```

### Phase 1️⃣ - PLAN (Day 1)

         Test scenarios defined
         Story points assigned
         ✅ READY TO CODE
```

### Phase 2️⃣ - DEVELOP (Days 2-3)
```
BUILD GATE #1: dotnet build B2X.slnx
    ↓ FAIL? FIX IMMEDIATELY
    ↓ PASS? Continue

Write code + tests (80%+ coverage)
    ↓
Mark agent changes: 🤖 AGENT-GENERATED
    ↓
BUILD GATE #2: dotnet test B2X.slnx
    ↓ FAIL? FIX IMMEDIATELY
    ↓ PASS? Push to GitHub

RULE: ONLY YOU modify this code
      No other developer can push to your branch
```

## ⚙️ Build Gates - THE ABSOLUTE RULES

| Gate | When | Command | If Fail |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **#1** | Before commit | `dotnet build B2X.slnx` | Fix now, cannot commit |
| **#2** | Before push | `dotnet test B2X.slnx` | Fix now, cannot push |
| **#3** | PR submitted | CI runs automatically | Developer fixes immediately |

```
❌ NO EXCEPTIONS
❌ NO "I'LL FIX LATER"
✅ FIX IMMEDIATELY BEFORE PROCEEDING
```

---

## 📝 Code Ownership - CRITICAL

```
YOU pulled this issue
    ↓
YOU own this code
    ↓
ONLY YOU can modify it
    ↓
No other developer touches this code
    ↓
If reviewer requests changes:
  - Reviewer writes comment
  - YOU read comment
  - YOU make change
  - Reviewer approves (doesn't push)
```

**Reviewers Cannot Do:**
- ❌ Push changes to your branch
- ❌ Merge PRs
- ❌ Modify your code

**You Must Do:**
- ✅ Address all review feedback
- ✅ Write tests reviewer requests
- ✅ Document APIs properly
- ✅ Push updated code

## 🐛 QA Finds a Bug - What Happens

```
QA testing → Finds bug
    ↓
QA creates issue in GitHub
    ↓ Assigns to YOU
    ↓ Links to original issue #XXX
    ↓ Provides clear steps to reproduce
    ↓
YOU get notified
    ↓
YOU reproduce locally
    ↓
YOU write test for bug
    ↓
YOU fix the code
    ↓
YOU push fix
    ↓
QA re-tests
    ↓
Bug fixed? → Closes issue ✅
Still broken? → YOU fix again
```

**Key**: QA does NOT fix your code
         QA reports, YOU fix, QA verifies
