2. **Complete Code Review** (EMAIL-001) - Independent task
3. **Start ADR Reviews** (ARCH-001) - After security approval

### Medium Priority
4. **Team Review Session** (ARCH-002) - After ADR approval
5. **GitHub Issue Creation** (ARCH-003) - Administrative

### Low Priority
6. **Core Provider Implementation** (ARCH-004-P1) - After all reviews

## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- **None** - All tasks have clear next steps

### Potential Risks
- **Security Review Delay:** Could impact critical path timeline
- **ADR Rejection:** Might require ADR revisions
- **Code Review Findings:** Could require refactoring

### Mitigation
- **Parallel Work:** Code review running independently
- **Early Communication:** Daily standup identifies issues early
- **Contingency Planning:** Have backup plans for high-risk items
