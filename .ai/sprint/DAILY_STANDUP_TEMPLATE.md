   - "Need decision by EOD"
   - "Escalate to @TechLead"

## 📈 Velocity Tracking

**Daily totals flow to:**
- ITERATION_001_TRACKING.md (main file)
- ITERATION_001_METRICS.md (dashboard)

**Running total formula:**
```
Today's Total = Sum of all SP reported in standup
Running Total = Yesterday's Total + Today's Total
Progress = Running Total / 28 SP target
```
