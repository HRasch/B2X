## 🎯 Key Principles

**Iteration 001 operates on these principles:**

1. **No Fixed Dates** - Continues until 28 SP reached or all items done
2. **Velocity-Based** - Progress measured in story points, not calendar time
3. **Daily Tracking** - Work logged daily, metrics refreshed EOD
4. **Independent Phases** - Phase 1 (25 SP) fully independent, no blockers
5. **Quality First** - Tests pass, code reviewed, architecture documented
6. **Transparent Progress** - All teams report daily, metrics visible to all
7. **Blocker Management** - Issues escalated immediately, not held until standup
