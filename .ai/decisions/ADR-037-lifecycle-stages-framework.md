# ADR-037: Lifecycle Stages Framework

## Status

**Accepted** - Approved by @Architect, @TechLead on 2026-01-05

## Context

B2Connect is currently in pre-release development (version 0.x), governed by [GL-014]. As the project matures toward v1.0 and beyond, we need a comprehensive lifecycle management framework that:

1. **Defines clear stages** from experimental to end-of-life
2. **Sets expectations** for stability, breaking changes, and support
3. **Enables component-level tracking** (different components may be at different stages)
4. **Automates enforcement** via CI/CD and tooling
5. **Communicates status** to developers and stakeholders

### Current Limitation

GL-014 only covers the pre-release phase. We lack:
- Formal definition of other stages (Alpha, RC, Stable, LTS, Maintenance, EOL)
- Stage transition criteria
- Component-level stage tracking
- Tooling integration

## Decision

We will implement a **7-stage lifecycle framework** with both project-level and component-level tracking.

### Lifecycle Stages

### Component-Level Stages

Different components can be at different lifecycle stages:

```yaml
# .ai/config/lifecycle.yml (proposed)
project:
  name: B2Connect
  default-stage: pre-release
  version: 0.8.0

components:
  core-api:
    stage: pre-release
    version: 0.8.0
    
  admin-frontend:
    stage: pre-release
    version: 0.8.0
    
  store-frontend:
    stage: pre-release
    version: 0.8.0
    
  cli:
    stage: alpha
    version: 0.0.3
    note: "Experimental features under development"
    
  erp-connectors:
    stage: alpha
    version: 0.0.1
    note: "Plugin architecture being designed"
    
  search-service:
    stage: pre-release
    version: 0.7.0
```

### Tooling Integration

#### 1. CI/CD Stage Enforcement

```yaml
# Proposed CI behavior
stages:
  alpha:
    - Skip backwards compatibility tests
    - Minimal documentation check
    - Allow experimental dependencies
    
  pre-release:
    - Skip backwards compatibility tests
    - Basic documentation check
    - Dependency audit (warning only)
    
  release-candidate:
    - Full test suite required
    - Documentation completeness check
    - Security scan required
    - No new features allowed
    
  stable:
    - Full test suite required
    - Backwards compatibility tests
    - Breaking change detection
    - Deprecation validation
```

#### 2. Stage Badges

```markdown
![Stage: Pre-Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-pre--release-orange)
![Stage: Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-stable-green)
![Stage: LTS](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-LTS-blue)
```

#### 3. PR Templates

Stage-aware PR templates with appropriate checklists.

### Documentation Updates

| Document | Action |
|----------|--------|
| [GL-014] | Rename to "Lifecycle Stages Framework" or archive |
| [GL-015] | Create "Stable Release Policy" (activated at v1.0) |
| README.md | Add lifecycle stage badge |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Document stage-appropriate contribution guidelines |
| PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md | Add component stage tracking |

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Clear Expectations**: Developers and stakeholders understand stability guarantees
2. **Flexible Development**: Alpha/pre-release components can iterate rapidly
3. **Enterprise Ready**: LTS track supports enterprise deployment needs
4. **Automated Enforcement**: CI/CD validates stage-appropriate behavior
5. **Component Independence**: Different components can evolve at different paces

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: More stages to manage and communicate
2. **Tooling Investment**: CI/CD and documentation tooling required
3. **Cognitive Load**: Team must understand stage implications

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Stage confusion | Clear documentation, badges, automated checks |
| Premature stable declaration | Strict transition criteria, sign-offs |
| LTS support burden | Capacity planning before LTS designation |
| Component stage drift | Regular lifecycle reviews |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation (Week 1)
- [ ] Finalize this ADR
- [ ] Update GL-014 or create new lifecycle guideline
- [ ] Update DOCUMENT_REGISTRY.md

### Phase 2: Configuration (Week 2)
- [ ] Create `.ai/config/lifecycle.yml`
- [ ] Document current component stages
- [ ] Add stage badges to README

### Phase 3: Tooling (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Create stage-aware PR templates
- [ ] Implement CI stage validation (basic)
- [ ] Add PROJECT_DASHBOARD component tracking

### Phase 4: Automation (Future)
- [x] Basic CI/CD stage validation (`.github/workflows/lifecycle-validation.yml`)
- [ ] Full breaking change detection
- [ ] Automated transition checks
- [ ] Stage change notifications

## Alternatives Considered

### A. Keep Simple (GL-014 only)
- **Pros**: Simpler, less overhead
- **Cons**: No framework for post-v1.0, no component-level tracking
- **Decision**: Rejected — need long-term lifecycle management

### B. Full Semantic Versioning from Start
- **Pros**: Industry standard
- **Cons**: Pre-release overhead, blocks rapid iteration
- **Decision**: Rejected — current GL-014 approach better for 0.x

### C. Stage-per-Guideline
- **Pros**: Clear separation
- **Cons**: Document sprawl, harder to maintain
- **Decision**: Partially adopted — GL-014 becomes lifecycle doc, GL-015 for stable
