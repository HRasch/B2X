# Testing Subagents Archive Notice

## Archive Date: January 1, 2026

## Reason for Archival
As part of Phase 1 implementation of agent responsibility optimization, all testing-related subagents have been consolidated under the unified **@QA** agent to eliminate confusion and improve efficiency.

## Archived Subagents

### Testing Subagents (Consolidated under @QA)
- **SubAgent-ComplianceTesting.agent.md** → Consolidated into @QA compliance testing responsibilities
- **SubAgent-IntegrationTesting.agent.md** → Consolidated into @QA integration testing responsibilities
- **SubAgent-RegressionTesting.agent.md** → Consolidated into @QA regression testing responsibilities
- **SubAgent-UnitTesting.agent.md** → Consolidated into @QA unit testing responsibilities
- **SubAgent-Performance.agent.md** → Consolidated into @QA performance testing responsibilities

## New Unified Structure

**@QA Agent Responsibilities (Consolidated)**:
- Unit Tests: Backend business logic, validator isolation, repository patterns
- Integration Tests: API endpoints, database transactions, service boundaries
- E2E Tests: Complete user journeys, cross-browser, responsive design
- Accessibility Tests: WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- Security Tests: OWASP Top 10, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning
- Performance Tests: Load testing, metrics analysis, bottleneck identification
- Compliance Tests: GDPR, NIS2, AI Act, E-Commerce legal (P0.6-P0.9)

## Benefits of Consolidation
- **Single Point of Contact**: All testing inquiries route through @QA
- **Eliminated Confusion**: No more delegation complexity between multiple agents
- **Improved Efficiency**: 30% reduction in testing cycle time expected
- **Unified Quality Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage across all quality dimensions
- **Streamlined Communication**: Direct coordination with development teams

## Migration Notes
- All testing responsibilities now owned by @QA agent
- No delegation to subagents - unified testing strategy
- Existing test automation and processes maintained
- Enhanced tool ownership across all testing dimensions
