# Phase 1 AI Security and Cost Optimization Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document coordinates the kickoff of Phase 1 AI security and cost optimization initiatives for B2Connect. Phase 1 focuses on establishing secure and cost-effective AI foundations within 0-3 months.

## Phase 1 Focus Areas (0-3 months)

### 1. Security Foundations (Immediate - 1 month)
**Lead Agents:** @Security + @Architect

**Objectives:**
- Implement comprehensive AI security baseline
- Input/output validation for all AI endpoints
- Adversarial attack detection and mitigation
- Secure model deployment with access controls

**Deliverables:**
- Security baseline documentation
- Validation framework
- Monitoring setup

**Timeline:** Complete within 1 month

### 2. Cost Monitoring Setup (Immediate - 2 weeks)
**Lead Agents:** @FinOps + @DevOps

**Objectives:**
- Deploy real-time cost monitoring and alerting
- Cloud cost tracking for AI workloads
- Budget alerts and automated shutdowns
- Cost attribution by feature/team

**Deliverables:**
- Cost monitoring dashboard
- Alerting system
- Baseline metrics

**Timeline:** Complete within 2 weeks

### 3. Model Optimization (1-2 months)
**Lead Agents:** @DataAI + @Performance

**Objectives:**
- Optimize existing models for efficiency
- Model quantization and pruning
- Batch processing implementation
- Caching for repeated queries

**Deliverables:**
- Optimized model versions
- Performance benchmarks
- Cost analysis

**Timeline:** Complete within 1-2 months

## Cross-Team Coordination
- **@Procurement**: Begin vendor evaluation for AI services with cost focus
- **@Legal**: Review security and compliance requirements for AI features
- **@ProductOwner**: Prioritize AI features based on cost-benefit analysis

## Success Criteria
- Security baseline implemented and tested
- Cost monitoring operational with alerts
- At least one AI model optimized with 20%+ cost reduction
- Documentation updated with implementation details

## Timeline
Complete Phase 1 within 3 months with weekly progress updates.
