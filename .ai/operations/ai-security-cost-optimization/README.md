# AI Security and Cost Optimization Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation on securing and optimizing AI-based features for sustainable production deployment. The materials were developed through coordinated feedback from key agents: @DataAI, @Security, @FinOps, @Procurement, @Architect, @Performance, and @Legal.

## Documents

### [consolidated-feedback.md](consolidated-feedback.md)
Consolidated feedback from all participating agents covering security concerns, cost optimization opportunities, architectural considerations, and operational requirements.

### [recommendations.md](recommendations.md)
Prioritized recommendations with implementation timelines, responsible agents, and expected impact. Organized by urgency and strategic importance.

### [risk-assessment.md](risk-assessment.md)
Comprehensive risk assessment covering security vulnerabilities, cost overruns, operational challenges, and regulatory compliance risks with mitigation strategies.

### [success-metrics.md](success-metrics.md)
Key performance indicators, monitoring frameworks, and success criteria for measuring the effectiveness of AI security and cost optimization initiatives.

## Key Themes
