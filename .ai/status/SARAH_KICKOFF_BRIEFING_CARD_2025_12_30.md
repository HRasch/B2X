## 🚨 POTENTIAL BLOCKERS (Pre-empt These)

1. **Source docs unclear** → Share links Monday morning
2. **People have conflicts** → Confirm availability now
3. **Requirements fuzzy** → Use task list as spec
4. **Multiple owners same file** → Assign ONE clearly
5. **Draft quality issues** → Review template ready

---

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA (For Friday Sign-off)

- ✅ 5 KB files created (1,900+ lines)
- ✅ All links validated
- ✅ INDEX.md updated with 20+ keywords
- ✅ All files follow Knowledge Base format
- ✅ Team sign-off: "Ready to publish"
- ✅ No blockers remaining

---

## 📞 DAILY STANDUP TEMPLATE (5 min, async OK)

```
COMPLETED (yesterday):
- [what?] - [blocker? none/x]

TODAY (goals):
- [what?]

BLOCKERS:

- [ ] Links valid (try clicking 3 random ones)
- [ ] Spelling/grammar professional
- [ ] Enough detail for self-service learning

---

## 🎉 FRIDAY DEPLOYMENT TASKS (Your List)

1. **Merge all drafts** into final versions
2. **Update INDEX.md** trigger keywords (add 20+)
3. **Validate all links** (5 min spot check)
4. **README callout** to KB in docs/ (if needed)
5. **Run git diff** to review changes
6. **Team final approval** (Slack message: "Ready to publish?")
7. **Commit & push** to main
8. **Announce** on team chat: "Phase 1 LIVE 🚀"

---

## 💬 PITCH TO TEAM (Use in kickoff)

> We're investing 30 hours over 5 days to build a Knowledge Base that saves every new developer 2-3 days of onboarding and cuts architecture errors in half.
>
> **The Problem:** Right now, questions like "How do I create an API endpoint?" = 30-min manual explanation. "Where does this service go?" = 20-min architecture chat.
>
> **The Solution:** 5 reference documents with patterns, examples, and decision trees.
>
> **The Payoff:** 
> - Next new dev: 1-day onboarding (not 3+ days)
> - Every feature: proven patterns (not reinvented)
> - Every code review: on business logic (not patterns)
> - Your time: freed up for harder problems
>
> **Timeline:** Monday-Friday, parallel work, your choice of which file.
>
> **Why now:** Burnout happens when we reinvent patterns. Excellence happens when we document once and reuse forever.
>
> **Questions?** Let's discuss!
