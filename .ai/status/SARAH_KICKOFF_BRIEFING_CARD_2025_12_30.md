## 📅 EXECUTION FLOW (Event-Driven, No Fixed Schedule)

| Event | Action | Owner | Trigger |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Now | Send materials + assign tasks | You | Immediate execution |
| Team acknowledges | Work begins (parallel) | All teams | Event-driven start |
| Drafts submitted | Review + feedback | You | Work completion |
| Refinements done | Validation | @Architect | Feedback applied |
| All files validated | Deploy to main | You | Validation complete |

**No artificial waiting.** Tasks flow naturally. Teams work at own pace. Move to next phase when previous completes.

---

## 💪 TEAM WORK BREAKDOWN

| Team | File | Hours | Deadline | Owner |
|------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Backend | WOLVERINE_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md (400 lines) | 5-6h | Wed | Senior dev |
| Backend | DDD_BOUNDED_CONTEXTS_REFERENCE.md (300 lines) | 3-4h | Wed | Lead/Arch |
| Frontend | VUE3_COMPOSITION_PATTERNS.md (400 lines) | 5-6h | Wed | Primary |

| You | Update docs/ai/INDEX.md (keywords, links) | 4h | Fri | You |

**Total team effort**: ~30 hours over 1 week (highly parallel)

---

## 🚨 POTENTIAL BLOCKERS (Pre-empt These)

1. **Source docs unclear** → Share links Monday morning
2. **People have conflicts** → Confirm availability now
3. **Requirements fuzzy** → Use task list as spec
4. **Multiple owners same file** → Assign ONE clearly
5. **Draft quality issues** → Review template ready

---

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA (For Friday Sign-off)

- ✅ 5 KB files created (1,900+ lines)
- ✅ All links validated
- ✅ INDEX.md updated with 20+ keywords
- ✅ All files follow Knowledge Base format
- ✅ Team sign-off: "Ready to publish"
- ✅ No blockers remaining

---

## 📞 DAILY STANDUP (Async, No Meetings)

Post in Slack once per day (any time):

```
✅ COMPLETED (yesterday):
- [what?] - [blocker? none/x]

🔄 TODAY (goals):
- [what?]

🚨 BLOCKERS:
- [none] or [X: needs SARAH help with Y]

📊 PROGRESS:
- [Green/Yellow/Red] - on track?
```

**No meetings.** Async updates. Real-time problem solving in Slack.

---

## 📝 VALIDATION (When Drafts Arrive)

For each file, verify:
- [ ] Content accurate (check examples work)
- [ ] Formatting consistent (headers, code blocks)
- [ ] Links valid (try clicking 3 random ones)
- [ ] Spelling/grammar professional
- [ ] Enough detail for self-service learning
- [ ] Matches source documentation intent
- [ ] Team suggests improvements? Note them

**Provide feedback immediately** (no waiting). Teams iterate right away.

---

## 🎉 DEPLOYMENT (When All Files Validated)

1. **Merge all drafts** into final versions
2. **Update INDEX.md** trigger keywords (add 25+)
3. **Validate all links** (5 min spot check)
4. **README callout** to KB in docs/ (if needed)
5. **Run git diff** to review changes
6. **@Architect final approval** (Slack message: "Ready to publish?")
7. **Commit & push** to main
8. **Announce** on team chat: "Phase 1 LIVE 🚀"

**No wait time.** Deploy immediately once validation complete.

## 💬 PITCH TO TEAM (Send in Initial Message)

> We're activating KB Integration Phase 1 **right now** (event-driven, no scheduling).
>
> **What**: Build a Knowledge Base that saves every new developer 2-3 days of onboarding.
>
> **The Problem**: Questions like "How do I create an API endpoint?" = 30-min manual explanation. "Where does this service go?" = 20-min architecture chat.
>
> **The Solution**: 6 reference documents with patterns, examples, and decision trees.
>
> **Your Task**: Create 1-2 files from your area (5-8 hours each).
>
> **Timeline**: No schedules. Work at your own pace. Daily async standup. Deploy when all files validated.
>
> **The Payoff**: 
> - Next new dev: 1-day onboarding (not 3+ days)
> - Every feature: proven patterns
> - Every code review: on business logic (not patterns)
> - Your time: freed up for harder problems
>
> **Ready?** Assignments below. Start whenever you're ready. Slack if stuck.
