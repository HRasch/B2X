# Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing Framework

## Overview
The Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing Framework establishes structured processes for mandatory cross-training sessions, shared knowledge bases, and automated knowledge transfer to eliminate knowledge silos and improve collaboration efficiency.

## Core Components

### 1. Mandatory Cross-Training Program
**Frequency**: Bi-weekly sessions (2 hours each)
**Participation**: All agents required
**Format**: Rotating domain presentations + Q&A

#### Session Structure
- **Domain Deep Dive**: Agent presents their domain expertise (30 min)
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: How domain connects with others (20 min)
- **Q&A and Collaboration**: Open discussion on integration points (40 min)
- **Action Items**: Specific collaboration improvements identified (10 min)

#### Rotation Schedule
- **Week 1**: @Backend presents .NET/Wolverine patterns
- **Week 2**: @Frontend presents Vue.js 3 architecture
- **Week 3**: @QA presents comprehensive testing strategy
- **Week 4**: @Security presents security frameworks
- **Week 5**: @Architect presents system design patterns
- **Week 6**: @DevOps presents infrastructure automation

### 2. Shared Knowledge Base Integration
**Central Repository**: `.ai/knowledgebase/` (primary ownership: GitHub Copilot)
**Automated Updates**: Knowledge automatically captured from agent activities
**Cross-References**: Automatic linking between related knowledge areas

#### Knowledge Categories
- **Technical Patterns**: Implementation patterns, best practices
- **Integration Points**: How domains connect and communicate
- **Common Challenges**: Recurring issues and solutions
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Shared tools and their capabilities
- **Process Documentation**: Workflow patterns and improvements

### 3. Automated Knowledge Transfer
**Real-time Capture**: Agent activities automatically documented
**Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities
**Proactive Sharing**: Relevant knowledge pushed to appropriate agents

#### Implementation Mechanisms
- **Activity Logging**: All agent actions logged with context
- **Pattern Analysis**: ML identifies collaboration patterns and gaps
- **Automated Alerts**: Knowledge relevant to current tasks highlighted
- **Integration Points**: Automatic cross-references in documentation

## Knowledge Sharing Protocols
