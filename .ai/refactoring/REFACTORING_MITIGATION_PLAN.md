# B2X Refactoring Mitigation Plan

## Automated Analysis Results

This plan was generated based on automated gap analysis of the B2X codebase.

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Path Updates Required
- Update all hardcoded references to AppHost, Backend, Frontend directories
- Modify build scripts and configuration files
- Update Docker and Kubernetes manifests

### 2. External Dependencies
- Identify and update external systems referencing old paths
- Coordinate with monitoring and security teams
- Update CI/CD pipelines and deployment scripts

### 3. Security Considerations
- Verify certificate paths remain valid
- Test authentication and authorization after moves
- Ensure secrets management continues to work

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 days)
- [ ] Run all discovery scripts
- [ ] Document all external dependencies
- [ ] Create backup of current state
- [ ] Set up monitoring for path changes

### Phase 2: Path Updates (2-3 days)
- [ ] Update all internal references
- [ ] Modify build configurations
- [ ] Update deployment scripts
- [ ] Test builds with new structure

### Phase 3: External Coordination (1-2 days)
- [ ] Notify external systems owners
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Coordinate with security team
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 4: Validation (2-3 days)
- [ ] Full system testing
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Deployment verification

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
- Maintain backup of original structure
- Document rollback procedures
- Test rollback process before starting

### Monitoring Plan
- Set up additional logging during transition
- Monitor for increased error rates
- Have incident response team on standby

### Communication Plan
- Notify all stakeholders of timeline
- Provide regular status updates
- Document changes for future reference

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All builds pass with new structure
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] External systems continue to function
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting work correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Timeline

Total estimated duration: 6-10 days
- Preparation: Days 1-2
- Implementation: Days 3-5
- Validation: Days 6-8
- Go-live: Day 9
- Monitoring: Days 9-10
