## 🎯 Execution Model

### What's Different?
- **No Fixed Dates:** Iteration continues until goals met
- **Velocity-Based:** Measure progress in story points, not days
- **Flexible Sequencing:** Teams adjust work order as needed
- **Phase-Based:** Planning (Setup) → Execution (Development) → Validation (Review)
- **Continuous Tracking:** Daily velocity updates, no calendar-based burndown

### When Does Iteration End?
Iteration 001 completes when **ANY of these occur:**
1. ✅ 28 SP velocity achieved (target), OR
2. ✅ All 34 committed items completed, OR
3. ✅ Team decision to close for retrospective

### Key Principle
**Deliver value continuously, not by calendar deadline.**

## 🚨 Key Reminders

### What Stays the Same
✅ All 34 SP work is still planned  
✅ Same team and responsibilities  
✅ Same quality standards  
✅ Same architecture review (8.5/10)  
✅ All issue assessments unchanged  

### What Changes
🔄 No fixed dates (Jan 2-13)  
🔄 No calendar-based task scheduling  
🔄 No week-by-week breakdown  
🔄 Velocity-based completion (28 SP target)  
🔄 Phase-based execution (flexible order)  

### Critical Dependencies
⏳ **Issue #15** deferred to Iteration 2 (awaiting @Legal)  
⏳ **Issues #20-#28** blocked by #15  
🟢 All **Phase 1 & 2** work is unblocked
