# Subagents Resource Library ("Lazy Experts")

This folder contains SubAgent definition files maintained as a resource library of "lazy experts": concise, specialist templates authored by subject-matter experts for on-demand use. These are not obsolete files — they're intentionally compact helpers designed to be invoked when specific expertise is required.

Purpose:
- Preserve compact SubAgent templates for quick reference and reuse.
- Provide on-demand templates for creating new agent definitions or restoring specialized behaviours.

Usage:
- Agents and tools should not treat these files as active agent personas when enumerating runtime agents; instead, treat them as reference templates.
- These are current, authoritative templates. Prefer the consolidated family agent files for canonical workflows; use the "lazy experts" as targeted, specialist guidance.
- To re-instate a SubAgent as active, open an issue or PR and assign `@SARAH` / `@GitManager` for governance.

Maintenance:
- Keep files small and focused; link to family agent guidance for broader processes.
- Update this README if policies for reuse or re-activation change.
