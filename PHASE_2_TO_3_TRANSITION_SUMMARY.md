- Proper TypeScript interfaces for test mocks (`Mock{ServiceName}`)
- Any type replacement with specific interfaces
- Systematic removal of unused variables and imports

## ✅ Enhanced Automation Tools

**legacy-code-cleanup.js** now includes:
- ✅ Interface creation functions for component settings
- ✅ Any type replacement with proper types
- ✅ Automated interface generation for test mocks
- ✅ Enhanced analysis with Phase 2 patterns
- ✅ Improved reporting with detailed statistics
- ✅ Auto-fix capabilities for identified patterns

## 📊 Phase 2 Script Performance

**Files Processed**: 972 total files
**Files with Issues**: 123 files identified
**Total Issues Found**: 1,648 issues
**Auto-fixed Issues**: 100 issues resolved
**Any Types Replaced**: 5 instances
**Remaining Manual Fixes**: 1,543 issues (require interface creation)

## 🎯 Phase 3 Preparation Complete

**Ready for Automated Expansion**:
- Enhanced script can now identify Phase 2 patterns across codebase
- Auto-fix capabilities implemented for safe automated changes
- Interface generation logic ready for component settings
- Pattern recognition improved for broader application

## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Team Review**: Present Phase 2 results and scaling plan
2. **Automated Expansion**: Run enhanced script on next 50 critical files
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add quality gates for automated validation
4. **Team Training**: Document established patterns and tools
5. **Monitoring**: Set up regular code quality audits

## 🎉 Success Metrics Achieved
